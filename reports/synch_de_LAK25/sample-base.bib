  abstract = {Learning analytics and educational data mining have come a long way in a short time. In this article, a lightlyedited transcript of a keynote talk at the Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference in 2019, I present a vision for some directions I believe the field should go: towards greater interpretability, generalizability, transferability, applicability, and with clearer evidence for effectiveness. I pose these potential directions as a set of six contests, with concrete criteria for what would represent successful progress in each of these areas: the Baker Learning Analytics Prizes (BLAP). Solving these challenges will bring the field closer to achieving its full potential of using data to benefit learners and transform education for the better.},

  abstract  = {The challenge of understanding how theory and analytics relate is to move “from clicks to constructs” in a principled way. Learning analytics are a specific incarnation of the bigger
               shift to an algorithmically pervaded society, and their wider impact on education needs
               careful consideration. In this chapter, we argue that by design — or else by accident — the
               use of a learning analytics tool is always aligned with assessment regimes, which are in
               turn grounded in epistemological assumptions and pedagogical practices. Fundamentally
               then, we argue that deploying a given learning analytics tool expresses a commitment to
               a particular educational worldview, designed to nurture particular kinds of learners. We
               outline some key provocations in the development of learning analytic techniques, key
               questions to draw out the purpose and assumptions built into learning analytics. We suggest
               that using “claims analysis” — analysis of the implicit or explicit stances taken in the design
               and deploying of technologies — is a productive human-centred method to address these
               key questions, and we offer some examples of the method applied to those provocations.},

  abstract = {Simonson, Schlosser and Hanson (1999) argue that a new theory called ``equivalency theory'' is needed to account for the unique features of the ``teleconferencing'' (synchronous) model of DE that is prevalent in many North American universities. Based on a comprehensive meta-analysis of the comparative literature of DE (Bernard, Abrami, Lou, Wozney, Borokhovski, Wallet, Wade, Fiset, \& Huang, in press), we are able to assess empirically whether equivalency has been achieved in prior comparative DE research. This paper includes a brief summary of the results of the split between synchronous and asynchronous patterns of DE, and addresses the implications these data have for developing separate theories of DE for synchronous (i.e., group-based) and asynchronous (i.e., individualized) applications. We examine data based on achievement, attitude and retention outcomes and coded study features (i.e., methodological, pedagogical and media) relating to them.},

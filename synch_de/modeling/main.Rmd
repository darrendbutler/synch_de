# How to use a R Notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# RQ1: What is the relationship betwen practice and performance, considering only practice?

Practice is positively related to performance.

Note to self: you can compare models side by side with tab_model(m1, m2).
See also Defining own labels. https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/articles/tab_model_estimates.html

```{r}
if (!require("sjPlot")) {
  install.packages("sjPlot")
}
library(sjPlot)
model_pract <- lm(exam_points ~ unique_practice_questions_answered, data_z_scored)
summary(model_pract)

# Save predicted exam_points
data_z_scored$pred_exam_w_pract <- predict(model_pract, newdata = data_z_scored)

sjPlot::tab_model(model_pract, file= "simple_regression.html")
htmltools::includeHTML("simple_regression.html")

```
## Visualize Regression Model

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Function to visualize the regression model with percentage scaling
plot_regression_scaled <- function(data, x_var, y_var) {
  
  # Scale the x and y variables by their max to get percentages
  data$scaled_x <- data[[x_var]] / max(data[[x_var]], na.rm = TRUE)
  data$scaled_y <- data[[y_var]] / max(data[[y_var]], na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # Create the plot
  ggplot(data, aes(x = scaled_x, y = scaled_y)) +
    geom_point(color = "black", alpha = 0.5) +  # Scatter plot of the data points
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "blue") +  # Add the regression line with confidence intervals
    labs(title = "Linear Regression: Scaled Exam Points vs. Scaled Practice Questions Answered",
         x = paste("Unique Practice Questions Answered (%)"),
         y = paste("Exam Points (%)")) +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +  # Format x-axis as percentage
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +  # Format y-axis as percentage
    theme_minimal()
}

# Example usage
# Fit the model (assuming the data has been loaded)
# model_pract <- lm(exam_points ~ unique_practice_questions_answered, data)

# Call the function to plot
plot_regression_scaled(data_non_scaled, "unique_practice_questions_answered", "exam_points")


```

# RQ2: What is the relationship between practice and performance, accounting for education level?

## RQ2.1: Is there a main relatinship between practice and performance when cosidering education level?

```{r}
# Run an additive and interactive model 
print("Additive")
model_pract_edu_add <- lm(exam_points ~ unique_practice_questions_answered + education_level, data_z_scored)
summary(model_pract_edu_add)
```
## RQ2.2: Does the relationship between practice and performance change based on education level?

```{r}
print("Interactive")
model_pract_edu_int <- lm(exam_points ~ unique_practice_questions_answered * education_level, data_z_scored)
summary(model_pract_edu_int)
```

## RQ2.3: Is the relationship between practice and performance better explained by the addition or interaction of education group?

Interactive model better explains relationship between practice and performance when accounting for education.

```{r}
print("Compare Models")
# Compute analysis of variance between additive and interaction model
model_edu_int_add_int <- anova(model_pract_edu_add, model_pract_edu_int)
model_edu_int_add_int
```
### Why might the data suggest the interactive model is better?
Within each education group, the effect of practice was not significant (𝑝′𝑠 > .05), possibly due to a lack of statistical power as sample sizes within each group were only including an average of 𝑀 = 33.43 samples.
TLDR: Our Sample Size May not be large enough to estimate a relationship between practice and performacne 
within each education level.
 
```{r}
# small sample N
data_non_scaled$education_level %>% table  %>% as.numeric %>% mean

```

### Visualize Interaction
NOTE: Conrad has a graph for this already. We can adjust this here.

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Function to create interaction plot between unique_practice_questions_answered and education_level
plot_interaction <- function(data, x_var, y_var, education_level) {
  
  # Create the interaction plot
  ggplot(data, aes(x = data[[x_var]], y = data[[y_var]], color = data[[education_level]])) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +  # Scatter plot of the data points
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +  # Add the regression line with confidence intervals for each group
    labs(title = "Interaction between Unique Practice Questions Answered and Education Level",
         x = "Unique Practice Questions Answered",
         y = "Exam Points",
         color = "Education Level") +  # Legend title
    theme_minimal()
}

# Example usage
# Call the function to plot, assuming the dataset contains an "education_level" column
#plot_interaction(data_non_scaled, "unique_practice_questions_answered", "exam_points", "education_level")

```

# RQ2.4: Does the effect of practice on performance change as education level increases?

## Education as ordinal rank
I would rather report education as an ordinal variable to simplify the regression, but the difference in rates is interesting. However, I am concerned if it worth reporting because of the potential lack of stastical power given then each education groups only has 30 people on avarage in the sample.

```{r}
# Run an additive and interactive model 
print("Additive")
model_edu_ordinal_add <- lm(exam_points ~ unique_practice_questions_answered + education_level_ordinal_ranked, data_z_scored)
summary(model_edu_ordinal_add)

print("Interactive")
model_edu_ordinal_int <- lm(exam_points ~ unique_practice_questions_answered * education_level_ordinal_ranked, data_z_scored)
summary(model_edu_ordinal_int)

print("Compare Models")
anova(model_edu_ordinal_add, model_edu_ordinal_int)

# RQ3.3: Is the relationship between pracice and performance better explained when accounting for interaction or addition of prior instruction?

There is no difference between the additive or interactive model.

```

```{r}
# Assuming the vector is data_non_scaled$unique_practice_questions_answered

# Step 1: Find the maximum value
max_value <- max(data_non_scaled$unique_practice_questions_answered)

# Step 2: Count how many times the maximum value appears
count_max <- sum(data_non_scaled$unique_practice_questions_answered == max_value)

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of values in the vector
total_count <- length(data_non_scaled$unique_practice_questions_answered)

# Step 4: Calculate the percentage of values with the maximum value
percentage_max <- (count_max / total_count) * 100

# View the result
percentage_max
